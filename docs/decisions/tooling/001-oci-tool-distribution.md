# ADR 001: OCI-Based Tool Distribution

## Problem

The homelab repo uses Bazel for everything — builds, tests, formatting, image pushing, and developer tool management. The `bazel_env` rule in `tools/BUILD` builds ~20 tools (helm, crane, go, node, pnpm, buildifier, etc.) and symlinks them into a `bin/` directory that `.envrc` adds to `$PATH`. This creates three problems:

1. **Bazel is required for basic development** — Even viewing Helm templates or running `format` requires a working Bazel installation, toolchain download, and repository rule resolution. On an M-series Mac, `bazel run //tools:bazel_env` takes ~45 seconds on a warm cache and minutes on a cold one.

2. **No tool parity between environments** — Local development (macOS/aarch64), CI (Linux/x86_64), and Goose agent sandboxes (Linux/x86_64) each resolve tool versions independently. The Goose agent image (`charts/goose-agent/image/apko.yaml`) packages its own copies of `go`, `node`, `pnpm`, etc. — there's no guarantee these match what `bazel_env` provides locally.

3. **Local Bazel execution is inefficient** — Running `bazel test //...` or `bazel build //...` locally downloads the full Bazel toolchain, resolves all external dependencies, and executes on a single machine. BuildBuddy remote execution is faster (parallelism, shared caching, beefy runners) and already runs on every PR and push to main via `buildbuddy.yaml`.

---

## Proposal

Eliminate local Bazel entirely. Distribute developer tools as a multi-arch OCI image built in CI and pulled locally via `crane export`. All builds, tests, and formatting run remotely via BuildBuddy — triggered by pushing code rather than executing locally.

### Before and After

| Aspect                  | Today                                                | Proposed                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Developer tool setup    | `bazel run //tools:bazel_env` (~45s warm)            | `crane export` + extract (~5s)                              |
| Tool versions           | Resolved independently per environment               | Single multi-arch OCI image, identical everywhere           |
| Running tests           | `bazel test //...` (local execution)                 | Push → BuildBuddy remote execution → MCP to observe results |
| Formatting              | `bazel run //bazel/tools/format:fast_format` (local) | Push → CI format job → auto-commit fixes back               |
| Build graph queries     | `bazel query` (local)                                | `bb query` (remote via BuildBuddy) or BuildBuddy MCP tools  |
| Goose tool availability | Separate apko image with its own tool versions       | Same OCI tools image, shared versions                       |
| Claude Code version     | Installed independently per machine                  | Pinned in tools image, identical across all environments    |
| Bazel on dev machine    | Required                                             | Not required                                                |

## Architecture

### OCI Tools Image

A single multi-arch (x86_64 + aarch64) OCI image containing all developer tools. Wolfi packages install to standard paths (`/usr/bin/`, `/usr/lib/`), and the full image filesystem is extracted locally — no symlink indirection layer.

```

```

Built via apko (consistent with all other images in the repo), pushed to GHCR on every merge to main.

**Why full extraction instead of a symlink layer:** Earlier designs created a `/tools/bin/` directory with symlinks to `/usr/bin/` and extracted only that subtree. This broke on macOS — the symlinks resolved to the host's `/usr/bin/` (e.g., Xcode shims) instead of the image's binaries. Extracting the full filesystem avoids this entirely. Tools like Python also depend on their stdlib (`/usr/lib/python3.x/`), which only works when the full image is present.

Claude Code is included as a first-class tool — it's installed via `pnpm add -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` during the image build. This gives:

- **Pinned versions** across local dev, CI, and in-cluster agents
- **Goose replacement path** — in-cluster agents could run Claude Code directly instead of Goose, using the same skills, hooks, and CLAUDE.md from the repo
- **Consistent MCP configuration** — the `.mcp.json` and `.claude/` configs ship with the repo, and the CLI version matches what was tested against them

### Tool Pull Mechanism

Local development is macOS-only, so the bootstrap assumes `crane` is available (installable via `brew install crane`). `crane export` extracts a filesystem tarball from an OCI image without needing a container runtime — no Docker, no Podman, no platform mapping.

Local `.envrc` replaces the `bazel_env` integration:

```bash
TOOLS_DIR="$PWD/.tools"
if [[ ! -d "$TOOLS_DIR/usr/bin" ]]; then
  log_error "Run './bootstrap.sh' to install dev tools"
else
  PATH_add "$TOOLS_DIR/usr/bin"
fi
```

`bootstrap.sh` extracts the full image filesystem into `.tools/`:

```bash
crane export "$TOOLS_IMAGE" - | tar -xf - -C "$TOOLS_DIR"
```

No `--strip-components`, no path filtering. The image's `/usr/bin/go` becomes `.tools/usr/bin/go`, and the full dependency tree (stdlib, shared libs) is preserved at relative paths.

The `.tools/` directory is gitignored. Tools are refreshed daily or on demand.

**Bootstrap:** Run `./bootstrap.sh` on first clone. The script is macOS-only — it checks for Homebrew, installs `crane` if missing, and pulls the tools image. After that, `direnv allow` handles automatic refreshes via `.envrc`.

### Agent Integration

The tools image includes Claude Code, making it a viable base for in-cluster agents. Two integration paths:

**Option A — Tools image as agent base:** The `homelab-tools` image already contains `node`, `pnpm`, `go`, `git`, `gh`, and `claude`. An in-cluster agent pod mounts the repo, injects a `CLAUDE_AUTH_TOKEN` via `OnePasswordItem`, and runs `claude` directly. This could replace Goose entirely — Claude Code natively understands the repo's skills, hooks, and CLAUDE.md.

**Option B — Shared tools, separate agent image:** Keep a separate agent image but copy tools from `homelab-tools` to guarantee version parity. Agent-specific packages (e.g., Goose runtime) are added on top.

Option A is preferred — it eliminates the Goose ↔ LiteLLM ↔ Claude indirection and lets in-cluster agents use the exact same tool that local development uses.

### Remote Execution Workflow

All Bazel operations execute remotely. The developer workflow becomes:

```
Edit code
    │
    ▼
git push + open/update PR
    │
    ├──▶ BuildBuddy CI triggers on PR (or push to main)
    │    ├── Format check (formatters + gazelle)
    │    ├── Test suite (bazel test //...)
    │    └── Image push (main branch only)
    │
    ▼
Observe results via:
    ├── BuildBuddy MCP tools (buildbuddy-mcp-get-invocation, get-log, get-target)
    ├── GitHub PR checks (gh pr checks)
    └── BuildBuddy web UI (links in BES output)
```

### Remote Format Workflow

Today, `format` runs locally via `bazel run //bazel/tools/format:fast_format`. In the new model:

1. Developer pushes to a branch
2. CI "Format check" job runs formatters + gazelle
3. If changes are needed, CI commits them back to the branch
4. Developer pulls the format fixes

This is slower than local formatting but eliminates the need for local Bazel entirely. The CI format job already exists in `buildbuddy.yaml` — it just needs to commit fixes back instead of failing.

### Build Graph Queries

For `bazel query` (dependency inspection, target discovery):

- **`bb query`** — The BuildBuddy CLI can execute queries remotely via BuildBuddy RBE. Include `bb` in the tools image for this.
- **BuildBuddy MCP tools** — `buildbuddy-mcp-get-target` provides target-level information from recent invocations.
- **`bazel query` in CI** — For complex queries, push a script that runs the query in CI and outputs results.

Most query needs are covered by `bb query` running remotely.

### Missing Tools & Workflow Gaps

The OCI tools image is an opportunity to close gaps in the current `bazel_env` setup. These tools are either used in workflows but not distributed, or represent workflow gaps that should be filled:

#### Currently missing from `bazel_env`

| Tool         | Current status                                | Why it should be in the tools image                                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `gh`         | In goose-agent apko image, not in `bazel_env` | Essential for PR workflow (`gh pr create`, `gh pr merge --auto --rebase`)                                                                                          |
| `ruff`       | Only runs via Bazel lint aspect               | Useful for quick local Python linting without remote execution                                                                                                     |
| `shellcheck` | Only runs via Bazel lint aspect               | Useful for quick local shell script linting                                                                                                                        |
| `eslint`     | Only runs via Bazel lint aspect               | Useful for quick local JS linting                                                                                                                                  |
| `agent-run`  | Custom Go binary in `tools/agent-run/`        | CLI for triggering Goose agent tasks — needs to be available locally                                                                                               |
| `hf2oci`     | Custom Go binary in `tools/hf2oci/`           | CLI for HuggingFace model → OCI conversion                                                                                                                         |
| `claude`     | Installed independently per machine via npm   | Claude Code CLI — pinning version ensures skills, hooks, and MCP config are tested against a known version. Enables in-cluster agents to run Claude Code directly. |

#### Workflow gaps (new tooling needed)

| Workflow               | Gap                                                                                                                                                                              | Proposed solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ArgoCD app diffing** | `rules_helm/app.bzl` has a `diff` rule referencing `argocd-live-diff.sh`, but the script doesn't exist. No way to preview what a values.yaml change will do to the live cluster. | Create the diff script. Include `argocd` CLI in the tools image (already in multitool). The script should: render local Helm template → diff against live ArgoCD app manifests. Can also be exposed as an MCP tool via Context Forge. |
| **Manifest preview**   | `render_manifests` requires Bazel to run `helm template`. Without local Bazel, developers can't preview rendered manifests before pushing.                                       | `helm` is already in the tools image. Create a standalone `render` script that calls `helm template` directly with the right flags, without Bazel wrapping.                                                                           |
| **Lint without Bazel** | Linters (`ruff`, `shellcheck`, `eslint`) only run via Bazel aspects. Can't lint a single file quickly.                                                                           | Include linter binaries in the tools image. Add a `lint` script that runs them directly on changed files.                                                                                                                             |

## Implementation

### Phase 1: OCI Tools Image

- [x] Create `tools/image/apko.yaml` with all tools currently in `bazel_env` plus missing tools (`gh`, `ruff`, `shellcheck`, `eslint`)
- [ ] Include custom Go binaries (`agent-run`, `hf2oci`) — built in CI, copied into image
- [x] Create `tools/image/BUILD` with apko build + push rules (no symlink layer — full image extraction)
- [ ] Add `homelab-tools` image push to `buildbuddy.yaml` CI pipeline (push on main)
- [ ] Add ArgoCD Image Updater config for automatic digest updates
- [ ] Verify multi-arch (x86_64 + aarch64) build works

### Phase 2: Local Bootstrap

- [x] Update `.envrc` to PATH_add `.tools/usr/bin` (full image extraction, no symlink indirection)
- [ ] Add `.tools/` to `.gitignore`
- [x] Create `bootstrap.sh` — extracts full image filesystem via `crane export` (no path filtering)
- [ ] Update `README.bazel.md` to reflect new workflow
- [ ] Remove `bazel_env` rule from `tools/BUILD` (or deprecate)

### Phase 3: Standalone Workflow Scripts

- [ ] Create `argocd-live-diff.sh` — renders local Helm template, diffs against live ArgoCD app manifests
- [ ] Create standalone `render` script — calls `helm template` directly without Bazel
- [ ] Create standalone `lint` script — runs ruff/shellcheck/eslint on changed files
- [ ] Wire diff script into `rules_helm/app.bzl` (completing the existing `generate_diff` infrastructure)

### Phase 4: Remote-Only Execution

- [ ] Update `buildbuddy.yaml` format check to auto-commit fixes back to the branch
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md "Essential Commands" section — remove local `bazel build/test` references
- [ ] Update `.claude/skills/bazel/SKILL.md` — rewrite for remote-first workflow
- [ ] Update `.claude/settings.json` — remove `Bash(bazelisk:*)` permission, add `Bash(bb query:*)` if needed
- [ ] Add PreToolUse hook to block local `bazel build/test/run` commands (redirect to push + trigger)
- [ ] Verify `bb query` works remotely for common query patterns

### Phase 5: In-Cluster Agent Convergence

- [ ] Create agent sandbox template that uses `homelab-tools` image directly with `claude` as entrypoint
- [ ] Inject `CLAUDE_AUTH_TOKEN` via `OnePasswordItem` into agent pods
- [ ] Configure `.claude/` settings for headless/non-interactive mode
- [ ] Validate Claude Code runs in-cluster with MCP access to Context Forge (ClusterIP, no auth needed)
- [ ] Evaluate whether Goose agent can be deprecated in favor of direct Claude Code execution

## Security

No deviations from `docs/security.md`:

- **OCI image** — Built with apko (non-root uid 65532, minimal base, no shell in final image unless needed)
- **GHCR auth** — Uses existing `GHCR_TOKEN` in BuildBuddy secrets for push; pull is public (homelab repo is public)
- **No secrets in image** — Tools image contains only binaries, no credentials
- **Remote execution** — BuildBuddy auth via `bb login` (existing setup), no credential changes

## Risks

| Risk                             | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **GHCR outage blocks tool pull** | Low        | Medium | Cache `.tools/` locally with 24h TTL. Tools persist across outages.                                                                                                      |
| **Format auto-commit race**      | Medium     | Low    | CI format job creates a separate commit. Developer must pull before pushing again. Standard git workflow.                                                                |
| **Remote query latency**         | Medium     | Low    | `bb query` adds network round-trip (~1-2s). Acceptable for infrequent queries. BuildBuddy MCP covers common cases.                                                       |
| **Tool version drift**           | Low        | Medium | Single source of truth (apko.yaml). ArgoCD Image Updater pins digests. Version changes are tracked in git.                                                               |
| **`crane` not installed**        | Low        | Low    | Single prerequisite: `brew install crane`. Documented in README and `.envrc` error message. Once tools are pulled, the image itself contains `crane` for future updates. |
| **apko can't package all tools** | Medium     | Medium | Some tools (like `bb` itself) may not be in Wolfi repos. Fallback: download binary in a build step and copy into image.                                                  |

## Open Questions

1. **`format` auto-commit strategy** — Should CI push format fixes directly to the branch, or create a separate fixup PR? Direct push is simpler but may surprise developers who have local uncommitted changes.

2. **Tool staleness check** — The 24h TTL in `.envrc` is simple but coarse. Should we pin to a specific digest in a lockfile (e.g., `.tools.lock`) and only update when the lockfile changes? This would give reproducible tool versions but adds a manual update step.

3. **`bb` packaging** — The BuildBuddy CLI is distributed as a standalone binary, not a Wolfi package. How should it be included in the apko image — download in a pre-build step, or maintain a local apko package?

4. **Transition period** — Should we support both `bazel_env` and OCI tools during migration, or cut over atomically? Parallel support avoids breakage but doubles maintenance.

5. **Claude Code in-cluster auth** — Claude Code authenticates directly to Anthropic via a token from `claude setup-token`, stored in a `OnePasswordItem`. Including Claude Code in the tools image enables in-cluster agents to run it directly (potentially replacing Goose), using the same token.

6. **Claude Code version pinning** — Claude Code releases frequently. Should the tools image pin to a specific version (e.g., `@anthropic-ai/claude-code@1.x.y`), or track latest? Pinning avoids surprises but requires manual bumps. ArgoCD Image Updater can't help here since it's an npm package, not an image tag.
