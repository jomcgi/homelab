## Problem

ADR 002 sketched a per-route Cloudflare Cache Rule pattern as part of the "cacheable iff anonymous" invariant: each public endpoint would get its own rule matching its URI path. When the rule was actually deployed, three things became clear that 002 had not anticipated:

1. **The hostname is already a stronger filter than the path.** The monolith's routing layer maps `monolith/public/*` to `public.jomcgi.dev/*` and routes everything else (private SSR pages, authenticated APIs, internal services) through different hostnames. The hostname `public.jomcgi.dev` is therefore, by construction, only ever served by handlers that emit cookie-free anonymous responses. A per-path rule is redundant work the URL/host topology already does.
2. **Cloudflare's global "Browser Cache TTL" silently injects `max-age` into responses that omit it.** ADR 002 line 64 deliberately omits `max-age` from origin's `Cache-Control` header so browsers always re-ask the edge. With Browser Cache TTL set to a fixed value (the Cloudflare default is 5 days = 432000s), CF rewrites the response header to add `max-age=432000`, breaking the omission silently. The CDN cache works perfectly; browsers cache the homepage for 5 days and miss every deploy. ADR 002 did not document this knob.
3. **No verification methodology was specified.** "Verify cache hit ratio in CF analytics" (002 Phase 2) is too coarse for the actual failure modes we hit (`cf-cache-status: DYNAMIC` on every request before the rule landed; `max-age` injection after). A repeatable `curl -sI` probe sequence catches both classes in seconds.

This ADR records the design as actually deployed, fixes the silent-injection trap, and documents the verification protocol.

## Proposal

A single Cloudflare Cache Rule, scoped by hostname rather than path, paired with the global Caching → Configuration knobs needed to keep the rule's intent intact end-to-end.

## Architecture

Same three nested cache layers ADR 002 described, with the actual settings filled in:

```mermaid
graph LR
    Origin["FastAPI origin<br/>_CACHE_TTL=60s in-memory<br/>Sets s-maxage, omits max-age"] --> EdgeUpper["CF Tiered Cache<br/>(upper-tier POP)"]
    EdgeUpper --> EdgeLower["CF edge POP<br/>Honors origin Cache-Control<br/>SWR + SIE + strong ETags"]
    EdgeLower --> Browser["Browser tab<br/>No max-age → re-asks edge<br/>Future: setInterval poll"]
    Browser --> Display["Display tick<br/>Re-renders 'Xm ago' strings"]
```

| Layer                | Bounds staleness of          | TTL                                       | Source                                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Backend `_CACHE_TTL` | Origin response              | 60s                                       | `projects/monolith/home/observability/stats.py` |
| CF upper-tier        | Origin fetch deduplication   | Inherited from edge                       | Smart Tiered Caching (no per-rule TTL)          |
| CF edge              | Across page loads            | 60s fresh + 24h SWR + 1y SIE              | Origin `Cache-Control` honored by rule          |
| Browser              | Tab's in-memory `data.stats` | None (no `max-age` → always re-asks edge) | "Respect Existing Headers" preserves omission   |
| Display tick         | Formatted strings (`Xm ago`) | 30s                                       | `+page.svelte` `setInterval`                    |

The structural invariant — **"cacheable iff anonymous"** — now sits in three locks in series:

1. **Routing topology**: only `monolith/public/*` handlers serve `public.jomcgi.dev`. Authenticated/private code paths physically cannot respond on this hostname.
2. **Origin discipline**: `Cache-Control` is set explicitly on cacheable responses (`projects/monolith/frontend/src/lib/cache-headers.js`); other responses omit the header.
3. **CF rule**: hostname filter + "bypass cache if no Cache-Control" means anything that escapes locks 1 and 2 still won't be cached unless origin actively asked for it.

A single lock failing does not cause a leak. All three would have to fail simultaneously.

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Marquee age display tick — landed pre-002

- [x] `MARQUEE_ITEMS` as a `$state` rune in `projects/monolith/frontend/src/routes/public/+page.svelte`
- [x] `setInterval` re-runs `buildMarquee(data.stats)` every 30s

### Phase 2: Edge cache rule (this ADR's primary work)

- [x] Origin emits `Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=60, stale-while-revalidate=86400, stale-if-error=31536000` on `/public/*` (`projects/monolith/frontend/src/lib/cache-headers.js:6`, applied at `+page.server.js:221`)
- [x] Cloudflare Cache Rule deployed: match `http.host wildcard r"public.jomcgi.dev"`, action "Eligible for cache" + "Use cache-control header if present, bypass cache if not", "Serve stale while revalidating: ON", "Respect strong ETags: ON"
- [x] Verified `cf-cache-status: HIT` on repeated `/` requests with `age` header incrementing
- [ ] **Caching → Configuration → Browser Cache TTL: "Respect Existing Headers"** (currently set to 5 days — injecting `max-age=432000` into all responses; verified post-deploy 2026-05-06 via `curl -sI`)
- [ ] **Caching → Tiered Cache → Smart Tiered Caching: ON**
- [ ] **Caching → Configuration → Always Online: ON**
- [ ] Add `Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=60, stale-while-revalidate=86400` to `/api/home/observability/stats` FastAPI response (`projects/monolith/home/observability/router.py:251`)
- [ ] Add homepage client-side poll re-fetching `/stats` every ~5 min to update marquee without reload
- [ ] SigNoz alert: `cf-cache-status: MISS` rate sustained > 5% (existing follow-up from 002)

### Phase 3: Generalize and codify

- [ ] Document the pattern in `docs/services.md` so new public-data routes default to it
- [ ] Decide whether to bring CF Cache Rules / Caching configuration under IaC (Terraform `cloudflare_ruleset` + `cloudflare_zone_settings_override`). See open question 1.
- [ ] Audit other `/api/*` routes during the ships migration; promote ones that fit the criteria (anonymous, idempotent, polled by clients) to set `Cache-Control` headers — they will be cached automatically by the existing rule

### Verification protocol

Run after any change to CF caching configuration or origin `Cache-Control` headers:

```bash
# Hit 1: cold edge (or recently-warmed) — expect MISS or HIT with low age
curl -sI https://public.jomcgi.dev/ | grep -i 'cf-cache-status\|age:\|cache-control'

# Hit 2: 2s later — expect HIT, age incremented by ~2
sleep 2 && curl -sI https://public.jomcgi.dev/ | grep -i 'cf-cache-status\|age:\|cache-control'

# Hit 3: past s-maxage=60 — expect HIT (refreshed) or REVALIDATED (304 path)
sleep 65 && curl -sI https://public.jomcgi.dev/ | grep -i 'cf-cache-status\|age:\|cache-control'
```

Expected, post-fix:

- `cf-cache-status: HIT` (or `REVALIDATED`) on hits 2 and 3
- `age` header present and monotonically incrementing within a window
- `cache-control` is **exactly** `public, s-maxage=60, stale-while-revalidate=86400, stale-if-error=31536000` — no `max-age` directive

If `cache-control` contains `max-age=…`, Browser Cache TTL is overriding origin (see risks table). If `cf-cache-status: DYNAMIC`, the rule isn't matching the request — check the rule is enabled and ordering.

---

## Security

Reference `docs/security.md` for baseline. The cacheable-iff-anonymous constraints from 002 still apply:

- **Never cache authenticated endpoints.** With the hostname-wide rule, private routes are protected by the routing topology — authenticated handlers are not reachable on `public.jomcgi.dev` because they're not mounted there. This is a stronger guarantee than per-path rules but only as strong as the routing config. **Any change to Helm/Envoy that exposes a private handler under `public.jomcgi.dev` would silently make its responses cacheable if it set `Cache-Control: s-maxage`.** Treat the routing layer as a load-bearing security boundary.
- **No PII or per-user fields in any response served from `public.jomcgi.dev`.** Once at the edge, the response is served to anyone with the URL.
- **No `Set-Cookie` on any response served from `public.jomcgi.dev`.** CF refuses to cache responses with `Set-Cookie` and silently degrades to origin-hit-per-request.
- **Rate-limit at the origin as defense-in-depth.** A misconfigured rule (or a CF outage routing past the edge) should not assume the edge is always in front.

Routing-as-security-boundary is new with this ADR. Worth adding to the security review checklist when modifying ingress / Envoy / Helm release names.

## Open Questions

1. **IaC for CF rules and zone settings.** Carried forward from ADR 002 open question 3, now sharper: the Browser Cache TTL gotcha would be invisible in a dashboard-only world (no diff to review when someone changes a zone setting), but trivially diff-able under Terraform. Lean: yes, codify under Terraform once a second CF resource needs the same treatment. Premature with one rule + a few zone settings.
2. **`cached_at` as a required field on every cached response.** Carried forward from 002 open question 4. Helps clients show "data from Ns ago" and detect SWR-served fossilized payloads. Lean: convention not enforcement until a second cached endpoint exists.
3. **FastAPI `@public_cacheable` decorator.** Carried forward from 002 open question 1. Same answer as 002: wait until phase 3 and a second caller exists.
4. **Hostname expansion.** If we ever want to cache a second public hostname (e.g., a future `blog.jomcgi.dev`), do we add a second rule, or expand the wildcard? Lean: separate rule per hostname so each can evolve independently.
