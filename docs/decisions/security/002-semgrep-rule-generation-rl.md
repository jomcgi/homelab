# RL-Finetuned Model for Security-Incident-Driven Semgrep Rule Generation

## Problem

When a security incident occurs — a CVE is published, a vulnerability is
disclosed, or an internal audit surfaces a new attack pattern — the immediate
question is: **"are we affected?"** Answering that requires a Semgrep rule that
detects the specific vulnerability pattern in code. Today, writing that rule is
expensive and slow.

A single taint-mode rule with sources, sinks, propagators, and sanitizers can
take hours to author. The engineer must understand the vulnerability class, the
target framework's API surface, and Semgrep's pattern language. The gap between
disclosure and a working detection rule is a window of exposure — filled today
by human rule authors at Semgrep or by security engineers writing custom rules.

**The goal is a model that takes a security incident description as input and
produces a working Semgrep detection rule as output.** The model is specifically
rewarded for generating rules that catch the vulnerability pattern described in
the incident, not just any syntactically valid rule.

The homelab already has the infrastructure to support this:

- **Semgrep Pro rules** vendored via OCI/Bazel with daily auto-updates
  ([ADR 001](001-bazel-semgrep.md)) — each rule maps to a specific CWE/CVE,
  providing natural (incident description → detection rule) training pairs
- **semgrep-core-proprietary** OCaml binary invoked directly, bypassing the
  Python wrapper (0.12s vs 2s per invocation) — enables programmatic reward
  computation during RL training
- **RTX 4090** on the worker node with 24GB VRAM — sufficient for QLoRA
  training of a 9B parameter model
- **Pro engine test fixtures** available internally (Semgrep employee access)
  — provide ground-truth test cases for each security rule

The missing piece is a training pipeline that turns these assets into a model
that can read a security incident and produce a detection rule.

## Proposal

Finetune **[Qwen 3.5 9B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B)** to generate Semgrep detection rules from
security incident descriptions (CVE advisories, CWE descriptions, vulnerability
disclosures) using a two-phase approach: supervised finetuning (SFT) for syntax
acquisition, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) where the
reward signal is **whether the generated rule actually detects the described
vulnerability** — measured by executing the rule against known-vulnerable and
known-safe code via semgrep-core.

Start with **Python-only** (largest corpus, richest taint coverage), designed
for multi-language expansion via LoRA adapter bank.

## Architecture

### Training Data Pipeline

#### Sources and Volumes

Data from the authenticated Semgrep scan config API (117,168 total rules), after
excluding 114,303 SCA supply-chain advisory rules (`ssc-*` IDs with `sca_info`
metadata):

**Python corpus (RL target):**

| Source                                    | Python Rules | Test Fixtures                          | Overlap                                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Semgrep Pro rules (authenticated API)     | 881          | Internal test suite (multi-file taint) | —                                         |
| Community rules (`semgrep/semgrep-rules`) | 273          | Co-located `.py` files (344 have them) | Zero with Pro                             |
| OpenGrep (`opengrep/opengrep-rules`)      | 263          | Co-located `.py` files                 | 99% duplicate of community — **excluded** |
| **Total**                                 | **1,154**    | **~1,154 with validated test cases**   |                                           |

**Full SAST corpus (all languages, for multi-language SFT):**

| Language   | Pro       | Community | Total     | Taint     | Taint % |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ------- |
| Python     | 881       | 273       | 1,154     | 852       | 74%     |
| TypeScript | 170       | 158       | 328       | 219       | 67%     |
| JavaScript | 171       | 156       | 327       | 219       | 67%     |
| Java       | 178       | 118       | 296       | 155       | 52%     |
| C#         | 138       | 33        | 171       | 130       | 76%     |
| Go         | 69        | 85        | 154       | 69        | 45%     |
| Ruby       | 23        | 73        | 96        | 40        | 42%     |
| PHP        | 29        | 39        | 68        | 44        | 65%     |
| Kotlin     | 63        | 18        | 79        | 21        | 27%     |
| Rust       | 49        | 4         | 53        | 39        | 74%     |
| Swift      | 53        | 2         | 55        | 16        | 29%     |
| C/C++      | 51        | 5         | 56        | 27        | 48%     |
| Other      | 11        | 134       | 145       | 1         | 1%      |
| **Total**  | **1,767** | **1,098** | **2,865** | **1,832** | **64%** |

OpenGrep was evaluated and excluded: 263 of 266 rule IDs are identical to the
community repo. It's a fork, not an independent source.

The authenticated API also returned 114,303 "custom" origin rules — these are
**entirely SCA/supply-chain advisory rules** (every one has `sca_info` metadata
and `ssc-` UUID prefixes). They check for vulnerable dependency versions, not
code patterns, and are excluded from training.

#### Pro Rule Characteristics (Python)

The Pro Python corpus is overwhelmingly taint-mode, requiring cross-file
analysis for correct reward computation:

| Property                        | Count | % of Pro Python |
| ------------------------------- | ----- | --------------- |
| Taint mode (`mode: taint`)      | 794   | 90%             |
| Cross-file / interproc analysis | ~730  | ~83%            |
| With propagators                | ~700  | ~80%            |
| With sanitizers                 | ~710  | ~81%            |
| Pattern mode (non-taint)        | 87    | 10%             |

This distribution means the model must learn to produce taint rules with
sources, sinks, propagators, and sanitizers — not just pattern-matching rules.
The reward function must use the Pro engine with `-pro_inter_file` to correctly
evaluate cross-file taint rules.

#### Multi-Language SFT Strategy

Taint rule structure is **language-agnostic YAML**: sources, sinks, propagators,
and sanitizers compose the same way in Python, Java, Go, and JavaScript. The
language-specific parts (pattern syntax within `pattern:` fields) use a common
grammar with language-specific AST node names.

This means training SFT on **all 2,865 SAST rules across all languages** teaches
the model the compositional structure of Semgrep rules — the "grammar" of taint
analysis — without needing language-specific reward computation. Python-only RL
(Phase 2) then teaches detection semantics within that structure.

| Phase | Data scope                  | Rationale                                                                            |
| ----- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SFT   | All languages (2,865 rules) | Taint structure is language-agnostic; 2.5× more training signal for rule composition |
| RL    | Python only (1,154 rules)   | Reward requires semgrep-core execution against Python test fixtures                  |

Benefits of multi-language SFT:

- **2.5× more training examples** for learning rule structure (2,865 vs 1,154)
- **Cross-language transfer**: a taint rule pattern learned from a Java SSRF rule
  helps generate a Python SSRF rule — the source/sink/sanitizer composition is
  identical, only the pattern strings differ
- **Reduced overfitting risk**: larger dataset with structural diversity prevents
  the model from memorizing Python-specific patterns during SFT

#### CWE Vulnerability Class Grouping

Rules are grouped by CWE class, not individual rule ID. The model learns to
detect vulnerability _classes_, not to reproduce specific rules.

| CWE     | Description                        | Pro | Community | Total |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- | --- | --------- | ----- |
| CWE-918 | Server-Side Request Forgery        | 278 | 5         | 283   |
| CWE-89  | SQL Injection                      | 169 | 23        | 192   |
| CWE-73  | External Control of File Name/Path | 108 | —         | 108   |
| CWE-502 | Deserialization of Untrusted Data  | 73  | 12        | 85    |
| CWE-78  | OS Command Injection               | 42  | 33        | 75    |
| CWE-327 | Use of Broken Crypto Algorithm     | 34  | 26        | 60    |
| CWE-79  | Cross-Site Scripting               | 11  | 30        | 41    |
| CWE-798 | Hard-coded Credentials             | 38  | —         | 38    |
| CWE-94  | Code Injection                     | 35  | —         | 35    |
| CWE-22  | Path Traversal                     | 34  | 5         | 39    |

Pro and community corpora are complementary: Pro is heavy on SSRF, SQLi, and
path traversal (framework-specific taint rules); community is stronger on XSS,
OS command injection, and weak crypto (pattern-matching rules).

Note: the top 10 CWE classes account for ~134 of 273 community Python rules.
The remaining ~139 community rules span CWE classes outside the top 10, or lack
CWE metadata entirely — these participate in SFT (learning rule syntax) but
cannot be CWE-grouped for RL reward computation without manual CWE annotation.

Each CWE group contains:

```
CWE-89: SQL Injection
├── pro_rules/                  # 169 taint rules across Django, Flask, SQLAlchemy, ...
├── community_rules/            # 23 pattern-matching rules
├── test_fixtures/
│   ├── core_positive/          # Canonical vulnerable code (must catch)
│   ├─��� variant_positive/       # Subtle variations (should catch)
│   ├── core_negative/          # Safe parameterized queries (must NOT flag)
│   └── edge_negative/          # Tricky safe patterns (bonus)
└── prompts/
    ├── CWE-89 MITRE description
    ├── CVE-2024-XXXXX advisory text
    └── Rule message field variants
```

#### Train/Eval Split Strategy

Time-based split using **CVE publication date from NVD** to prevent data
contamination from the base model's pretraining data:

| Split             | CVE Window     | Count (est.) | Purpose                              |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Train**         | Pre-2025       | ~1,100       | Within Qwen 3.5's pretraining window |
| **Validation**    | Jan – Dec 2025 | ~100         | Grey zone — hyperparameter tuning    |
| **Held-out eval** | 2026+          | ~98          | Guaranteed unseen by base model      |

The eval tests true generalization: given a brand-new CVE in a CWE class the
model trained on, can it produce a working rule for an unseen library/pattern?

The daily Pro rule update pipeline (`.github/workflows/update-semgrep-pro.yaml`)
automatically delivers fresh rules for new CVEs, creating an ever-growing eval
set.

### Reward Architecture

The reward function is the core innovation — it uses **semgrep-core execution**
to measure behavioral correctness, not just syntactic validity.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "GRPO Generation (vLLM colocate)"
        PROMPT["CVE/CWE<br/>description"] --> VLLM["vLLM PagedAttention<br/>on 4090"]

    end

    subgraph "Reward Computation (CPU, 16-way parallel)"
        CANDS --> EXEC["semgrep-core<br/>-pro_inter_file<br/>× 16 candidates"]

        GATE --> REL["Relative reward<br/>across all 16"]
        REL --> GRAD["Liger GRPO loss<br/>+ LoRA update"]
    end
```

#### semgrep-core Invocation

The same approach used in the Bazel test pipeline
(`bazel/semgrep/defs/semgrep-test.sh`), calling the OCaml binary directly:

```bash
# Stage Pro + OSS binaries in same directory (Pro requires co-located OSS)
PRO_DIR="/tmp/semgrep-engines"
cp semgrep-core "$PRO_DIR/"
cp semgrep-core-proprietary "$PRO_DIR/"

# Invoke with cross-file taint analysis
SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN=offline \
SEMGREP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:0 \
"$PRO_DIR/semgrep-core-proprietary" \
    -rules /tmp/candidate_rule.yaml \
    -pro_inter_file \
    -lang python \
    /tmp/test_fixtures/ \
    -json -json_nodots
```

Key configuration:

| Setting                   | Value                | Why                                                           |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN`       | `offline`            | Pro engine checks for presence, not validity                  |
| `SEMGREP_URL`             | `http://127.0.0.1:0` | Prevents phoning home; engine works fully offline             |
| `-pro_inter_file`         | —                    | Enables cross-file taint analysis (required for 76% of rules) |
| `-json -json_nodots`      | —                    | Machine-readable output, no progress dots                     |
| Co-located `semgrep-core` | Same directory       | Pro binary requires OSS binary as runtime dependency          |

**Performance:** 0.12s per invocation (vs 2.0s through pysemgrep). The 1.88s
difference is entirely Python wrapper startup — the OCaml engine's actual parse

- match time is ~11ms.

| Scenario                     | Time   |
| ---------------------------- | ------ |
| pysemgrep (Python wrapper)   | 2.0s   |
| semgrep-core (OCaml, direct) | 0.12s  |
| Actual parse + match work    | 0.011s |

#### Hierarchical Reward Scoring

Reward is computed **per CWE group** using a **hierarchical gating** structure.
Each gate isolates a distinct failure mode — a high-recall rule with many false
positives is structurally different from a precise rule with low recall, and the
reward function must treat them differently.

```
Gate 1: Parse validity
│
├─ FAIL → soft penalty (0.05 during epoch 1, hard 0 thereafter)
│
└─ PASS → Gate 2: Precision constraint
             │
             ├─ ANY core_negative hit → capped at 0.1 × (1 - FP_rate)
             │   (gradient toward fewer FPs even while capped)
             │
             └─ ZERO core_negative hits → Gate 3: Detection recall
                  │
                  ├─ core_positive recall × 0.5
                  ├─ variant_positive recall × 0.2
                  └─ edge_negative avoidance × 0.1
                       (bonus: 0.8 base + 0.2 × avoidance rate)
```

| Gate | Condition                 | Effect                                                                                           |
| ---- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Valid Semgrep YAML        | Soft penalty (0.05) in RL epoch 1, hard zero thereafter                                          |
| 2    | Zero `core_negative` hits | Reward capped at `0.1 × (1 - core_negative_hit_rate)` if violated — gradient toward fewer FPs    |
| 3    | Detection recall          | `core_positive` recall × 0.5 + `variant_positive` recall × 0.2 + `edge_negative` avoidance × 0.1 |

Gate 2 uses a soft cap rather than a flat ceiling. A rule that hits 1 of 20
core_negatives scores `0.1 × 0.95 = 0.095`, while a rule that hits all 20
scores `0.1 × 0 = 0`. This gives GRPO gradient signal to distinguish "slightly
over-broad" from "wildly over-broad," preventing early-RL candidates from
piling up at an identical capped score with no learning signal.

**Why hierarchical gating:** With a flat weighted score, the model can trade
precision for recall and still achieve a decent reward. Gating forces the model
to solve precision before recall optimization begins — GRPO first learns "don't
over-match," then pushes recall upward within that constraint.

**Why soft parse gate in epoch 1:** If the SFT checkpoint produces rules that
parse ~80% of the time, a hard zero gate gives 20% of GRPO samples zero reward
regardless of how close they were to valid YAML. A soft penalty (0.05) preserves
gradient signal for near-misses during early RL, then anneals to a hard gate
once parse rate stabilizes above 95%.

GRPO computes relative rewards across all 16 candidates per prompt. No absolute
reward model or value network is needed — this is simpler and more stable than
PPO for programmatically-verifiable tasks. A group size of 16 keeps advantage
estimate variance manageable (variance scales as ~1/N), producing stable policy
gradients without requiring DeepSeek-R1's N=64.

| Kernels  | Unsloth (Triton)              | ~80% VRAM reduction for GRPO loss; ~1.8× training speed           |
| Trainer  | TRL `GRPOTrainer`             | GRPO loop with native PEFT/QLoRA + custom reward function support |
| Generate | vLLM (`vllm_mode="colocate"`) | PagedAttention KV cache management, colocated on same GPU         |
| Reward   | Custom Python callable        | Shells out to semgrep-core, applies hierarchical gating           |

TRL's `num_generations=16` parameter handles the N=16 group natively — vLLM's
PagedAttention manages KV cache across all 16 generations more efficiently than
manual micro-batching. No application-level batching logic needed.

The Liger GRPO Loss optimization (integrated via Unsloth) avoids materializing
full logit tensors during the policy gradient computation, which is the primary
VRAM bottleneck during GRPO. This gives meaningful headroom on the 24GB budget.

#### VRAM Budget (GRPO Phase)

| Component                                                    | Estimate     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| Qwen 3.5 9B base (4-bit quantized via Unsloth)               | 5–6 GB       |
| LoRA adapters (rank 64–128, with rsLoRA scaling)             | 1–2 GB       |
| Optimizer states (AdamW)                                     | 2–3 GB       |
| KV cache (vLLM PagedAttention, 16 candidates)                | 3–5 GB       |
| Activations + gradients (Liger kernel, no full logit tensor) | 2–3 GB       |
| **Total**                                                    | **13–19 GB** |

Fits within 24GB. Unsloth's Triton kernels and Liger loss reduce the
activations/gradients footprint compared to vanilla TRL. If headroom allows,
increase LoRA rank or micro-batch size.

**rsLoRA scaling:** at LoRA rank 64+, standard alpha/r scaling causes gradient
instability. rsLoRA (rank-stabilized) uses √r scaling instead, which is
critical for the rank 64–128 range specified here.

**`max_new_tokens`** must be enforced at the generation level via vLLM config,
not post-hoc truncation. The sequence length cap (profiled in Phase 0) prevents
KV cache spikes from unexpectedly long candidates.

#### Training Phases

| Phase                | Method                              | Data                                     | Duration (est.) |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 0: Data construction | CPU-only                            | 2,865 rules (all langs) → grouped JSONL  | ~3 hours        |
| 1: SFT warmup        | Unsloth QLoRA, early stopping       | ~8–14K prompt/rule pairs (all languages) | ~2–3 hours      |
| 2: GRPO RL           | Unsloth + TRL + vLLM + semgrep-core | ~1,000 Python train prompts, N=16 groups | ~12–20 hours    |
| 3: Evaluation        | vLLM inference + semgrep-core       | ~98 held-out 2026+ CVEs                  | ~30 minutes     |
| **Total**            |                                     |                                          | **~1.5–2 days** |

Phase 2 is GPU-bound. vLLM colocate mode handles N=16 generation natively via
PagedAttention — no manual micro-batching. Unsloth's ~1.8× speedup over vanilla
TRL reduces wall-clock time. Semgrep scoring of all 16 candidates is negligible
(~0.24s parallel on CPU). Generation and scoring are serial within TRL's
synchronous GRPO loop.

#### Semgrep Execution Budget

With direct semgrep-core invocation and 8-way CPU parallelism:

```
Per GRPO step:  16 candidates × 0.12s = 1.92s serial → 0.24s parallel (8-way)
Full RL run:    1,000 prompts × 3 epochs × 0.24s ≈ 12 minutes
```

Semgrep execution is negligible. Training is entirely GPU-bound — micro-batch
generation (4 passes × inference time) dominates the step cost.

**Future optimization:** semgrep-core could be run as a long-lived process
accepting rules via file-watch instead of spawning a new process per candidate.
The 0.12s per invocation is dominated by OCaml binary startup (~109ms), not
actual parse+match work (~11ms). A persistent process would approach the 11ms
floor. Candidate rules with structurally identical ASTs could also be
deduplicated via hashing to skip redundant invocations.

## Key Decisions

| Decision                                    | Rationale                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Qwen 3.5 9B** (not 7B or 14B)             | 9B fits in 4-bit on 24GB VRAM with room for GRPO; strong coding capabilities; 262K native context; Apache 2.0; larger models OOM during RL        |
| **QLoRA** (not full finetune)               | Full finetune of 9B requires ~72GB VRAM (bf16); QLoRA fits in 14–19GB while preserving 90%+ of full finetune quality                              |
| **GRPO** (not PPO)                          | No value network needed — simpler, less VRAM, more stable for tasks with programmatic reward signals. Proven by DeepSeek-R1 for code generation   |
| **N=16 via vLLM**                           | Advantage estimate variance scales as ~1/N; N=16 balances signal quality against wall-clock cost. vLLM PagedAttention manages KV cache natively   |
| **Hierarchical reward** (not flat weighted) | Gating on precision before optimizing recall prevents the model from trading FPs for detection; orthogonal failure modes need separate gradients  |
| **SFT → RL** (not RL-only)                  | SFT warmup teaches Semgrep YAML syntax; RL on top teaches behavioral correctness. Direct RL from base model is too unstable for structured output |
| **Multi-language SFT, Python-only RL**      | SFT on all 2,865 rules (taint structure is language-agnostic); RL on Python only (requires semgrep-core execution). 2.5× more SFT signal          |
| **Python-first for RL**                     | Largest corpus (881 Pro rules), richest taint coverage (90%), most CWE classes. Designed for LoRA-per-language expansion                          |
| **CWE-grouped reward** (not per-rule)       | Trains the model to reason about vulnerability classes, not memorize specific rule patterns. Produces more generalizable rules                    |
| **CVE date-based eval split**               | Prevents data contamination from base model pretraining. 2026+ CVEs are guaranteed unseen                                                         |
| **semgrep-core direct** (not pysemgrep)     | 16× faster (0.12s vs 2.0s). Matches existing Bazel pipeline approach ([ADR 001](001-bazel-semgrep.md)). Makes reward computation negligible       |
| **Pro engine for reward** (not OSS)         | 76% of Pro rules use cross-file taint; OSS engine would give wrong reward signals for the majority of training data                               |
| **Exclude OpenGrep**                        | 99% overlap with community rules (263/266 identical IDs). Adds noise, not signal                                                                  |
| **Frontier benchmark required**             | Finetuned model must justify itself against Claude Opus/Sonnet with good prompting. If frontier wins on all axes, use prompting instead           |
| **Unsloth + TRL** (not OpenRLHF or verl)    | TRL GRPOTrainer has native PEFT/QLoRA + custom reward function support; Unsloth adds ~80% VRAM reduction + ~1.8× speed via Triton kernels         |
| **vLLM colocate** (not HF generate)         | Single-GPU colocated vLLM for generation within TRL's GRPO loop; PagedAttention handles N=16 natively without manual micro-batching               |
| **llama.cpp serving** (not vLLM/HF)         | Inference on the 4090 post-training via llama.cpp; zero marginal cost, sub-second latency, offline capable                                        |
| **Single-rule output**                      | One rule per CVE for MVP. Multi-rule output (e.g. Django + Flask rules from one CVE) is a future extension once single-rule pipeline is validated |

## Implementation

### Phase 0: Data Construction

- [ ] Write rule parser: extract id, message, metadata (CWE, OWASP, severity),
      pattern YAML from Pro + community rule files **across all languages**
- [ ] Filter out SCA rules (114,303 `ssc-*` supply-chain advisory rules with
      `sca_info` metadata) — retain only SAST rules (2,865 total)
- [ ] Build CWE grouping: map rules to vulnerability classes using metadata CWE
      fields
- [ ] Obtain Pro internal test fixtures (Semgrep employee access)
- [ ] Map test fixtures to CWE groups: categorize as core_positive,
      variant_positive, core_negative, edge_negative
- [ ] **Fixture oracle validation**: run existing Pro rules against their own
      test fixtures using the reward function and confirm they score 100%. If
      the oracle doesn't score perfectly on its own test data, the reward
      function is broken before training starts. This is a prerequisite gate
      for Phase 2
- [ ] Integrate community test fixtures (co-located files already available)
- [ ] Fetch CVE/CWE descriptions from NVD API for prompt construction
- [ ] Build prompt variants at **multiple specificity levels** (ordered
      hardest → easiest): (1) generic CWE description from MITRE, (2) ambiguous
      incident report, (3) partial vulnerability description with missing
      details, (4) specific CVE advisory text from NVD, (5) rule `message`
      field. During RL, use **curriculum scheduling**: start with Levels 4–5
      (specific prompts) so the model gets a foothold, then gradually mix in
      Levels 1–2 as reward stabilizes. SFT uses all levels uniformly
- [ ] Apply time-based split using CVE publication dates (train: pre-2025,
      val: 2025, eval: 2026+)
- [ ] **Profile token length distribution** of all Pro rules — determine
      appropriate `max_new_tokens` cap for generation. Complex taint rules
      with multiple sources/sinks/propagators/sanitizers may exceed 1,024
      tokens. Set cap at p95 of the distribution to avoid truncation artifacts
- [ ] **CWE class rebalancing**: sample RL training data proportional to
      √(class_count) per CWE — this reduces the 7:1 imbalance between CWE-918
      (283 rules) and CWE-79 (41 rules) to ~2.6:1, without hammering the sparse
      classes with 7× oversampling that would cause its own overfitting
- [ ] Output `sft_data.jsonl` — all 2,865 rules across all languages for
      multi-language SFT (with data augmentation: field order shuffling,
      prompt paraphrases)
- [ ] Output `rl_data.jsonl` — 1,154 Python-only rules with test fixtures for
      GRPO reward computation, CWE-rebalanced

### Phase 1: SFT Warmup (Multi-Language)

- [ ] Download [Qwen 3.5 9B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B) base
      weights
- [ ] Set up training environment: Unsloth + TRL on worker node
- [ ] Configure QLoRA: 4-bit quantization, LoRA rank 64–128, **LoRA dropout
      0.1–0.2** (critical for a dataset this small — 2,865 examples on a 9B
      model overfits fast), target modules (q_proj, k_proj, v_proj, o_proj,
      gate_proj, up_proj, down_proj)
- [ ] **Structural data augmentation before SFT**: shuffle order-invariant
      YAML fields (`metadata:` sub-fields like `cwe:`, `owasp:`, `confidence:`;
      ordering of `pattern-sources` vs `pattern-sinks` within taint rules).
      Hold fixed: `rules:` as top-level key, required fields (`id:`,
      `message:`, `severity:`), taint-mode structural keys. Vary indentation
      style, add/remove optional metadata fields. This teaches the model that
      rule structure is semantic, not positional
- [ ] Train SFT on **all 2,865 rules across all languages** — taint rule
      structure is language-agnostic YAML; multi-language training provides 2.5×
      more signal for learning rule composition
- [ ] **Early stopping with patience of 0.5 epochs**, keyed on **validation
      detection recall** (measured via semgrep-core on validation split), not
      validation loss — loss can decrease while recall plateaus if the model
      learns to produce "average" rules. Monitor at sub-epoch granularity
      (every 500 steps)
- [ ] Track per-CWE-class metrics across epochs — sparse classes (e.g. CWE-79
      with 41 rules) will overfit faster than dense classes (CWE-918 with 283)
- [ ] Save best SFT LoRA adapter checkpoint (by validation detection recall,
      not train loss)

### Phase 2: GRPO RL

- [ ] Install Unsloth + TRL with vLLM colocate support on worker node
- [ ] Build hierarchical reward function as a Python callable for TRL's
      `GRPOTrainer`: write candidate rule to disk → call semgrep-core → parse
      JSON results → apply gated scoring (parse → precision → recall) → return
      scalar
- [ ] Stage semgrep-core-proprietary + semgrep-core binaries for reward
      computation
- [ ] Configure TRL `GRPOTrainer`: `num_generations=16`,
      `vllm_mode="colocate"`, `max_new_tokens` from Phase 0 token profiling,
      enable Liger GRPO loss via Unsloth
- [ ] Configure QLoRA with **rsLoRA scaling** (√r instead of alpha/r) — critical
      for rank 64+ to prevent gradient instability
- [ ] Set RL learning rate to **5e-6** (not the 2e-4 used for SFT — Unsloth
      recommendation for GRPO)
- [ ] Implement soft parse gate: reward 0.05 for invalid YAML in epoch 1,
      anneal to hard zero gate after parse rate exceeds 95%
- [ ] Train GRPO on top of SFT checkpoint, save checkpoints at each epoch
- [ ] Monitor reward curves per gate level: parse rate should plateau early,
      precision gate pass rate should climb next, then detection recall —
      watch for reward plateau or decline (overfitting to specific test
      fixtures)
- [ ] **Reward overfitting check**: hold out a subset of test fixtures from the
      reward function and evaluate the model against them separately. If the
      model scores well on reward fixtures but poorly on held-out fixtures for
      the same CWE, it's gaming the tests rather than learning the vulnerability
      pattern
- [ ] Save best RL LoRA adapter checkpoint (by held-out fixture detection
      recall)

### Phase 3: Evaluation

- [ ] Run inference on held-out 2026+ CVE eval set
- [ ] Execute generated rules against test fixtures via semgrep-core
- [ ] Compute metrics: parse rate, detection recall per CWE class, false
      positive rate, taint correctness
- [ ] Compare against Pro rule oracle on same fixtures
- [ ] **Frontier model benchmark**: run the same eval prompts through Claude
      (Opus/Sonnet via Max subscription) with identical system prompt and
      scoring methodology — this is the bar the finetuned model must beat or
      match at lower cost/latency
- [ ] **Frontier few-shot variant**: also test frontier models with 3–5
      Pro-quality taint rules stuffed into the prompt as few-shot examples.
      This represents the strongest realistic prompting baseline — if Claude
      Opus with 5-shot taint examples already hits 90%+ detection recall, that
      significantly changes the success criteria math
- [ ] Compare finetuned 9B vs frontier (zero-shot and few-shot) across all
      metrics, document where each wins
- [ ] Document results and identify weak CWE classes for potential data
      augmentation

### Phase 4: Multi-Language RL Expansion (Future)

SFT already covers all languages. This phase adds **language-specific RL** with
semgrep-core execution against each language's test fixtures:

- [ ] Build Go reward pipeline (69 Pro taint rules + 85 community rules)
- [ ] Build JavaScript/TypeScript reward pipeline (327 rules, 219 taint)
- [ ] Build Java reward pipeline (296 rules, 155 taint)
- [ ] Train per-language LoRA adapters via GRPO on language-specific fixtures
- [ ] Build lightweight language router from CVE description
- [ ] Implement LoRA hot-swap at inference time on single base model

## Frontier Model Benchmark

### Why benchmark against frontier

The finetuned 9B model must justify its existence against the alternative:
prompting a frontier model (Claude Opus/Sonnet) with the same CVE description
and asking for a Semgrep rule. Tokens are cheap on a Max subscription — if
frontier+prompting achieves 90%+ quality, the finetuned model needs to
demonstrably win on at least one axis to be worth the training investment.

### Evaluation axes

| Axis                   | Frontier advantage                                                           | Finetuned 9B advantage                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Detection quality**  | Broader world knowledge, better reasoning about novel vulnerability patterns | RL reward signal directly optimizes for detection; may outperform on taint rule structure |
| **Parse rate**         | Likely high (frontier models are good at YAML)                               | SFT explicitly trains on Semgrep syntax; should be near 100%                              |
| **Latency**            | 2–10s per rule (API round-trip)                                              | <1s locally on 4090 via llama.cpp                                                         |
| **Cost at scale**      | ~$0.05–0.15 per rule (token costs)                                           | Free after training (~$0 marginal cost)                                                   |
| **Offline capability** | Requires internet                                                            | Fully local, air-gapped capable                                                           |
| **Taint rule quality** | General code understanding                                                   | Specifically trained on 850 taint rules with propagators/sanitizers                       |

### Benchmark methodology

Run the **identical eval pipeline** for both models on the held-out 2026+ CVE
set:

1. Same prompts (CVE/CWE description + "generate a Python Semgrep rule")
2. Same scoring (semgrep-core execution against grouped test fixtures)
3. Same metrics (parse rate, detection recall, false positive rate per CWE)

For frontier, test **two prompting configurations** to avoid a strawman
comparison:

1. **Zero-shot**: system prompt with Semgrep pattern syntax documentation only
2. **Few-shot**: system prompt + 3–5 Pro-quality taint rules as in-context
   examples (the strongest realistic prompting effort)

```
Eval matrix:

                              Parse    Detection   FP      Latency   Cost/rule
                              rate     recall      rate    (p50)     (marginal)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Claude Opus (zero-shot)        ?%       ?%         ?%      ~5s       ~$0.10
Claude Opus (5-shot)           ?%       ?%         ?%      ~8s       ~$0.15
Claude Sonnet (zero-shot)      ?%       ?%         ?%      ~2s       ~$0.03
Claude Sonnet (5-shot)         ?%       ?%         ?%      ~3s       ~$0.05
Qwen 9B (base)                 ?%       ?%         ?%      <1s       $0
Qwen 9B (SFT only)            ?%       ?%         ?%      <1s       $0
Qwen 9B (SFT+RL)              ?%       ?%         ?%      <1s       $0
Pro rule oracle               100%     100%        0%       —         —
```

The **base → SFT → SFT+RL** progression is as important as the absolute
numbers. Each phase should show measurable improvement:

- **Base → SFT delta**: proves the model learned Semgrep syntax and rule
  structure from supervised examples
- **SFT → RL delta**: proves the reward signal teaches behavioral correctness
  beyond imitation
- **Any delta**: even if the final model doesn't match frontier, a clear
  staircase of improvement validates the pipeline and signals that scaling
  up (larger model, more data) would close the gap

### Success criteria

The finetuned model is a success if **any** of these hold:

1. **Quality parity at zero marginal cost** — matches frontier detection recall
   within 5 percentage points, making bulk rule generation free
2. **Outperforms frontier on taint rules** — RL specialization produces better
   source/sink/propagator/sanitizer structure than general-purpose prompting
3. **Latency advantage matters** — sub-second generation enables interactive
   use cases (IDE integration, real-time CVE response) where API round-trips
   are too slow
4. **Offline/private operation** — the model runs entirely locally with no
   external dependencies, important for sensitive security work

### Outcome paths

The benchmark produces one of three outcomes, each with a clear next step:

```
                           Detection recall
                           vs frontier (%)
                                │
                    ┌───────────┼───────────┐
                    │           │           │

1. **Ship it** (≥95% of frontier quality) — the 9B model matches frontier on
   this narrow domain. Deploy locally on the 4090 via llama.cpp. Zero marginal
   cost, sub-second latency, offline capable.

2. **Scale up** (70–94% of frontier quality) — the pipeline works and the task
   is learnable, but the 9B model lacks capacity. This is strong signal to
   invest in a larger training run: same pipeline, bigger model (32B–70B),
   more data (community rules, synthetic augmentation), on cloud GPUs. The
   4090 run was a successful feasibility study that de-risks the investment.

3. **Pivot to prompting** (<70% of frontier quality) — the finetuned model
   doesn't justify itself. Use frontier with good prompting instead. The data
   pipeline and eval infrastructure become a prompt engineering + eval harness.

Outcome (2) is arguably the most valuable result — it proves the approach works
and provides a clear scaling roadmap. The training data, reward function, and
eval framework built in Phases 0–3 transfer directly to a larger run with no
rework.

## Security

### Data Sensitivity

- **Pro rules** are licensed under Semgrep Rules License v1.0. Training a model
  on them may have licensing implications — verify internally before any
  external distribution of the model or its outputs.
- **Pro test fixtures** are internal Semgrep assets. The finetuned model should
  be treated as containing proprietary signal.
- **Community rules** are MIT-licensed — no restrictions on training use.

### Model Access

The finetuned model (base weights + LoRA adapter) will run locally on the
worker node. No model weights or outputs are exposed externally.

### Generated Rule Review

Model-generated rules must be **human-reviewed** before deployment to
production scanning. The model is a drafting tool, not an autonomous scanner.

## Decided Questions

1. **Training framework** — TRL `GRPOTrainer` with Unsloth (Triton kernels) and
   vLLM colocate mode. TRL's native PEFT/QLoRA support and custom reward
   function interface fit the single-GPU QLoRA setup. Unsloth provides ~80%
   VRAM reduction and ~1.8× training speed via fused Triton kernels. vLLM
   colocate mode handles generation on the same GPU with PagedAttention KV
   cache management.

2. **Serving infrastructure** — llama.cpp on the RTX 4090 post-training. The
   4090 already hosts other inference workloads. llama.cpp supports GGUF
   quantized models with minimal overhead and integrates with the existing
   agent platform via OpenAI-compatible API.

3. **Multi-rule output** — Single rule per prompt for MVP. Training on
   single-rule output simplifies reward computation (one rule → one
   semgrep-core invocation → one score). Multi-rule generation (e.g., one rule
   per framework for a CVE affecting both Django and Flask) is a natural future
   extension once single-rule quality is validated.
