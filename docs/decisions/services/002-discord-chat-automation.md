## Problem

The Discord bot (`projects/monolith/chat/`) is purely reactive today — it only responds when @-mentioned or replied to. It stores messages with vector embeddings and can recall context, but it has no ability to:

- **Schedule actions** — "remind me to check the deploy at 3pm", "post a daily standup summary every morning"
- **React to events** — auto-respond to certain keywords, greet new members, trigger workflows when a message matches a pattern
- **Run proactive tasks** — periodic channel digests, sentiment monitoring, automated follow-ups
- **Chain multi-step workflows** — "when someone posts in #incidents, summarize it and cross-post to #status"

Additionally, the existing **summary system** (`summarizer.py`) works but is informal:

- Hardcoded 24h interval with no configurability
- Single `user_channel_summaries` table with a basic "2-4 sentences" prompt
- No channel-level summaries (only per-user)
- Summary content isn't seeded into the agent's context window in a structured way — it's only available via the `get_user_summary` tool (the bot has to decide to call it)
- No rolling window awareness — the summary prompt doesn't know how much context the bot already has from the recent 20-message window

NanoClaw and OpenClaw — two open-source AI agent frameworks with Discord integrations — solve these problems with scheduling, trigger systems, and per-group memory. Rather than adopting either framework wholesale (they bring their own runtimes, LLM routing, and container orchestration that would conflict with our stack), we can steal the best patterns and build them on top of what we already have: PydanticAI + pgvector + PostgreSQL.

## What NanoClaw / OpenClaw Offer

### NanoClaw (lightweight, ~3,900 LOC)

| Feature                 | How It Works                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Task Scheduler**      | SQLite table of scheduled jobs (cron, interval, one-shot). Polling loop picks up due tasks and executes them in ephemeral Docker containers. |
| **Per-Group Memory**    | Each Discord channel gets its own `CLAUDE.md` file on disk — persistent context the agent can read/write between invocations.                |
| **Trigger System**      | Message prefix matching (`@Andy`) + channel allowlists. Non-admin channels require explicit mention; admin channels respond to everything.   |
| **Agent Swarms**        | Multiple specialized agents collaborate via filesystem IPC with authorization validation.                                                    |
| **Concurrency Control** | Per-group semaphore (default 3 concurrent containers) prevents resource exhaustion.                                                          |

### OpenClaw (full-featured, larger ecosystem)

| Feature                  | How It Works                                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Skill Injection**      | 5,400+ skills discovered at runtime based on context. Only relevant skills loaded to save tokens. |
| **Cron Scheduling**      | Built-in cron + push notifications. Tasks run without user prompts.                               |
| **Reactive + Proactive** | Default reactive mode; becomes proactive with scheduled tasks that post to channels unprompted.   |
| **Multi-Platform**       | Single bot process handles Discord, Slack, Telegram, etc. via platform adapters.                  |
| **Capability Tokens**    | Skills receive scoped access tokens rather than full system access.                               |

### What We Should Steal

| Pattern                               | Source   | Why                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scheduled tasks in a DB table**     | NanoClaw | We already have PostgreSQL — no need for SQLite. A `chat.scheduled_tasks` table with a polling loop is simple and observable.                                           |
| **Event triggers / pattern matching** | Both     | NanoClaw's prefix matching is too basic; OpenClaw's skill injection is too heavy. A lightweight trigger table with regex patterns and action types hits the sweet spot. |
| **Per-channel persistent memory**     | NanoClaw | We already have `user_channel_summaries`. Extending this to channel-level "memory notes" the bot can read/write gives it persistent context without filesystem state.   |
| **Proactive channel posting**         | OpenClaw | The bot should be able to post without being mentioned — daily digests, scheduled reminders, event-driven alerts.                                                       |
| **Concurrency control**               | NanoClaw | Per-channel semaphore to prevent the bot from flooding a channel or exhausting LLM capacity.                                                                            |

### What We Should NOT Steal

| Pattern                               | Why Not                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Container-per-invocation**          | We run in Kubernetes with a single monolith pod. Ephemeral containers per message would be over-engineered and conflict with our deployment model. |
| **Custom LLM routing**                | We already have PydanticAI + llama.cpp with tool calling. No need for another LLM abstraction layer.                                               |
| **Filesystem IPC**                    | We have PostgreSQL. Agent communication via DB tables is more observable and survives pod restarts.                                                |
| **Skill marketplace / plugin system** | Over-engineering for a homelab. We add capabilities as PydanticAI tools in Python — no plugin discovery needed.                                    |
| **Multi-platform adapters**           | We only need Discord. Adding Slack/Telegram adapters would be YAGNI.                                                                               |

## Proposal

Add three new tables to the `chat` schema and a lightweight scheduler loop to the monolith's lifespan. The bot gains scheduling, triggers, and proactive posting while keeping the existing vector-backed conversational memory intact.

### New Schema: `chat.scheduled_tasks`

Tasks saved by users (via Discord commands or the bot itself) and polled by a background loop.

```sql
CREATE TABLE chat.scheduled_tasks (
    id              SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    channel_id      TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_by      TEXT NOT NULL,          -- discord user ID
    task_type       TEXT NOT NULL,          -- 'reminder' | 'digest' | 'custom'
    description     TEXT NOT NULL,          -- human-readable description
    action_prompt   TEXT NOT NULL,          -- prompt to run through the agent
    schedule_cron   TEXT,                   -- cron expression (NULL for one-shot)
    next_run_at     TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    last_run_at     TIMESTAMPTZ,
    enabled         BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at      TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),

    -- prevent duplicate firings across pod restarts
    run_lock        TIMESTAMPTZ             -- NULL = unlocked, set = claimed
);

CREATE INDEX idx_scheduled_tasks_next_run
    ON chat.scheduled_tasks (next_run_at)
    WHERE enabled = TRUE AND run_lock IS NULL;
```

### New Schema: `chat.triggers`

Pattern-matched reactions to messages (regex on content, user filters, channel filters).

```sql
CREATE TABLE chat.triggers (
    id              SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    channel_id      TEXT,                   -- NULL = all channels
    name            TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    pattern         TEXT NOT NULL,          -- regex matched against message content
    user_filter     TEXT,                   -- optional: only trigger for this user ID
    action_type     TEXT NOT NULL,          -- 'respond' | 'crosspost' | 'agent_run'
    action_config   JSONB NOT NULL,         -- action-specific config
    cooldown_secs   INT DEFAULT 0,          -- minimum seconds between firings
    last_fired_at   TIMESTAMPTZ,
    enabled         BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at      TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### New Schema: `chat.channel_memory`

Persistent per-channel notes the bot can read and write (inspired by NanoClaw's per-group `CLAUDE.md`).

```sql
CREATE TABLE chat.channel_memory (
    id              SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    channel_id      TEXT NOT NULL,
    key             TEXT NOT NULL,           -- e.g. 'channel_rules', 'ongoing_topics'
    value           TEXT NOT NULL,
    updated_at      TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),

    UNIQUE (channel_id, key)
);
```

### Formalized Summaries

The existing `chat.user_channel_summaries` table and `summarizer.py` loop are the seed of this — they just need to be formalized and extended.

#### What exists today

```
chat.user_channel_summaries
├── One row per (channel_id, user_id)
├── Rolling text summary ("2-4 sentences")
├── High-water mark (last_message_id) for incremental updates
└── Updated every 24h by a hardcoded asyncio loop
```

The `get_user_summary` tool lets the agent query these on demand, but the agent has to choose to call it. Summaries are never injected into the context automatically.

#### What changes

**1. Add channel-level summaries** — not just per-user, but a rolling summary of the entire channel. New row type in the same table (or a new `chat.channel_summaries` table):

```sql
CREATE TABLE chat.channel_summaries (
    id              SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    channel_id      TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    summary         TEXT NOT NULL,
    message_count   INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,  -- total messages summarized
    last_message_id INT NOT NULL,
    updated_at      TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**2. Configurable summary schedule** — move the hardcoded 24h loop into `chat.scheduled_tasks` as a built-in `digest` task type. This lets users change the interval per channel ("summarize #general every 6 hours, #incidents every hour").

**3. Structured prompt templates** — replace the hardcoded "2-4 sentences" prompt with configurable templates stored in `chat.channel_memory`:

| Key                      | Purpose                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `summary_prompt_user`    | Prompt template for per-user summaries (default: current behavior)                  |
| `summary_prompt_channel` | Prompt template for channel-level summaries                                         |
| `summary_style`          | Style hints: `brief` (2-4 sentences), `detailed` (paragraph), `bullet` (key points) |

**4. Auto-inject summaries into context** — instead of relying on the agent to call `get_user_summary`, inject a compressed context block at the top of every agent invocation:

```python
# In _generate_response(), before the user prompt:
channel_summary = store.get_channel_summary(channel_id)
user_summaries = store.get_relevant_user_summaries(channel_id, recent_user_ids)

context_header = ""
if channel_summary:
    context_header += f"Channel context: {channel_summary.summary}\n\n"
if user_summaries:
    context_header += "People in this conversation:\n"
    for s in user_summaries:
        context_header += f"- {s.username}: {s.summary}\n"
    context_header += "\n"
```

This gives the bot ambient awareness of who it's talking to and what the channel is about, without burning a tool call. The `get_user_summary` tool remains available for deeper queries about users not in the recent window.

**5. Rolling window awareness** — the summary prompt should account for the fact that the bot already sees the last 20 messages. The summarizer should focus on context _beyond_ the recent window:

```python
prompt = (
    f"You are summarizing {username}'s participation in a Discord channel.\n"
    f"The bot already sees the most recent 20 messages as direct context.\n"
    f"Focus your summary on patterns, topics, and context from OLDER messages "
    f"that would help the bot understand this person better.\n\n"
    f"Previous summary:\n{existing.summary}\n\n"
    f"New messages from {username}:\n{messages_text}\n\n"
    f"Write a concise summary (2-4 sentences) of this user's key topics, "
    f"interests, and communication style."
)
```

### Scheduler Loop

A new background task in the monolith lifespan, similar to the existing summary loop:

```python
async def scheduler_loop(interval: int = 30):
    """Poll chat.scheduled_tasks every `interval` seconds and execute due tasks."""
    while True:
        try:
            with Session(get_engine()) as session:
                now = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
                # Atomically claim due tasks (prevents double-fire on pod restart)
                due = session.exec(
                    select(ScheduledTask)
                    .where(
                        ScheduledTask.enabled == True,
                        ScheduledTask.next_run_at <= now,
                        ScheduledTask.run_lock == None,
                    )
                    .with_for_update(skip_locked=True)
                ).all()

                for task in due:
                    task.run_lock = now
                    session.add(task)
                session.commit()

                for task in due:
                    await execute_task(task)

        except Exception:
            logger.exception("Scheduler loop error")
        await asyncio.sleep(interval)
```

### Trigger Evaluation

Added to the existing `on_message` handler in `bot.py`:

```python
async def evaluate_triggers(self, message: discord.Message):
    """Check message against active triggers and fire matching ones."""
    with Session(get_engine()) as session:
        triggers = get_active_triggers(session, str(message.channel.id))
        for trigger in triggers:
            if re.search(trigger.pattern, message.content, re.IGNORECASE):
                if trigger.cooldown_secs and trigger.last_fired_at:
                    elapsed = (datetime.now(timezone.utc) - trigger.last_fired_at).total_seconds()
                    if elapsed < trigger.cooldown_secs:
                        continue
                await fire_trigger(trigger, message)
                trigger.last_fired_at = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
                session.add(trigger)
        session.commit()
```

### New Agent Tools

The bot gains three new PydanticAI tools so users can create automations conversationally:

| Tool              | Description                                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `schedule_task`   | "Remind me to check deploys every morning at 9am" → creates a row in `scheduled_tasks` with a cron expression |
| `manage_triggers` | "When someone posts in #incidents, summarize and crosspost to #status" → creates a trigger row                |
| `channel_notes`   | Read/write persistent channel memory — "remember that we decided to use gRPC for this service"                |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Formalize Summaries

Low-risk, high-value — extends what already works.

- Add `chat.channel_summaries` table via Atlas migration
- Add channel-level summary generation to `summarizer.py`
- Update summary prompts with rolling-window awareness ("bot already sees last 20 messages")
- Auto-inject channel + user summaries into agent context (no tool call required)
- Store prompt templates in `chat.channel_memory` for per-channel customization

### Phase 2: Scheduled Tasks (reminders & digests)

- Add `chat.scheduled_tasks` table via Atlas migration
- Add `ScheduledTask` SQLModel
- Add `scheduler_loop()` to monolith lifespan
- Add `schedule_task` PydanticAI tool
- Migrate the existing hardcoded 24h summary loop into a `scheduled_task` row (type `digest`)
- Support one-shot reminders and cron-based recurring tasks
- Add `croniter` dependency for cron expression parsing

### Phase 3: Event Triggers

- Add `chat.triggers` table via Atlas migration
- Add `evaluate_triggers()` to `on_message` handler
- Add `manage_triggers` PydanticAI tool
- Support: respond, crosspost, agent_run action types
- Cooldown enforcement to prevent spam

### Phase 4: Channel Memory & Proactive Posting

- Add `chat.channel_memory` table
- Add `channel_notes` PydanticAI tool
- Add configurable digest posting (LLM summarizes last N hours, posts to channel)
- Enable bot to post to channels proactively (not just in reply)

---

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Users can set up automations conversationally — no config files or deployments needed
- All state lives in PostgreSQL — observable, survives restarts, backed up with CNPG
- The existing vector memory + semantic search is preserved and enhanced
- Trigger evaluation is lightweight (regex match on a small table, not a full LLM call)
- Scheduled tasks use `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` for safe concurrency

**Negative:**

- 30-second polling means tasks fire up to 30s late (acceptable for a homelab)
- Regex triggers can be footguns (overly broad patterns → spam). Cooldowns and per-channel scoping mitigate this
- More LLM load from proactive tasks. Bounded by: one concurrent task per channel, configurable rate limits
- Schema migrations required for each phase

**Tradeoffs vs. adopting NanoClaw/OpenClaw directly:**

|                            | Adopt Framework                                | Build on Existing                     |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Time to first feature**  | Faster (pre-built)                             | Slower (custom code)                  |
| **Operational complexity** | Higher (new runtime, SQLite, Docker-in-Docker) | Lower (same monolith, same Postgres)  |
| **LLM integration**        | Must replace or bridge PydanticAI              | Native PydanticAI tools               |
| **Observability**          | Separate system to monitor                     | Same SigNoz traces, same CNPG metrics |
| **Maintenance**            | Upstream dependency risk                       | Full control                          |
| **Vector memory**          | Would need to replicate or bridge              | Already there                         |

## Open Questions

1. **Cron parsing library** — `croniter` is the de facto Python choice. Any concerns with adding it as a dependency?
2. **Task execution timeout** — should scheduled tasks have a hard timeout? NanoClaw uses container lifetime; we'd need an `asyncio.wait_for` wrapper.
3. **Trigger creation permissions** — should any Discord user be able to create triggers, or should it be restricted to specific roles?
4. **Digest format** — should daily digests be a simple summary or include links to specific messages?
5. **Channel memory size limits** — should we cap the size of channel memory notes to prevent unbounded growth?
6. **Summary token budget** — auto-injecting channel + user summaries adds tokens to every invocation. Should we cap total summary context (e.g. 500 tokens) and truncate/prioritize?
7. **Summary freshness** — the current 24h interval means summaries can be stale. For active channels, should we trigger a summary refresh when message count since last update exceeds a threshold?
