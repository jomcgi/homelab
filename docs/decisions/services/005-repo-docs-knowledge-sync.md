# ADR 005: Repo Markdown Knowledge Graph Sync via OCI Volume

**Author:** jomcgi
**Status:** Draft
**Created:** 2026-04-11

## Problem

The homelab repo contains markdown files spread across the entire tree — ADRs in `docs/decisions/`, design plans in `docs/plans/`, operational docs (`security.md`, `observability.md`), service-level READMEs, operator best practices (`projects/operators/best-practices.md`), `CLAUDE.md` files, and more. None of this is visible to the knowledge graph.

This means:

1. **Semantic search misses repo context** — asking "what decisions have we made about auth?" only surfaces personal vault notes, not the ADR that drove the middleware rewrite
2. **No cross-linking** — repo-derived knowledge can't form `derives_from` or `related` edges with personal knowledge atoms
3. **Stale knowledge persists** — when an ADR is superseded, a design plan is abandoned, or a service doc is removed, the knowledge graph has no mechanism to detect or remove outdated artifacts
4. **Scattered context** — service-specific docs, operator guides, and project instructions live alongside code but aren't discoverable via the knowledge API

The gardener already decomposes raw vault notes into typed knowledge artifacts (atoms, facts, active items). The gap is getting all repo markdown into its input pipeline — and cleaning up when files are removed or superseded.

---

## Proposal

Collect **all markdown files in the repo** into a lightweight OCI artifact at CI time via a top-level Bazel `filegroup` glob. Mount it as an init container volume in the monolith pod. The gardener treats the mount path as a second input directory alongside the vault, processing markdown into the knowledge graph with full decomposition, edge creation, and embedding.

A top-level `filegroup` in the root `BUILD` file (`repo_markdown`) globs all `**/*.md` files, excluding vendored/generated content. This single source of truth feeds both the OCI artifact build and any future tooling that needs repo-wide markdown access.

A **manifest file** (`manifest.json`) in the OCI artifact lists all included files with content hashes. On startup, the monolith compares the manifest against previously-processed repo docs and deletes `_processed/` artifacts whose source files no longer exist — solving the stale knowledge problem.

| Aspect                | Today            | Proposed                                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Repo docs in KG**   | Not indexed      | Decomposed into typed artifacts with edges              |
| **Update trigger**    | N/A              | CI rebuild on push to main → Image Updater bumps digest |
| **Deletion handling** | N/A              | Manifest diff removes orphaned artifacts                |
| **Runtime deps**      | N/A              | None — docs baked into OCI artifact at build time       |
| **Gardener changes**  | Scans vault only | Scans vault + repo docs mount                           |

## Architecture

### Build Pipeline

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[push to main] --> B[Bazel builds<br/>docs OCI artifact]
    B --> C[Push to GHCR<br/>ghcr.io/jomcgi/homelab/repo-docs:latest]
    C --> D[Image Updater<br/>bumps digest]
    D --> E[Pod restart<br/>init container copies docs]
    E --> F[Gardener processes<br/>new/changed docs]
```

### Bazel Filegroup

A top-level `filegroup` in the root `BUILD` file provides the canonical set of repo markdown:

```starlark
filegroup(
    name = "repo_markdown",
    srcs = glob(
        ["**/*.md"],
        exclude = [
            "node_modules/**",
            "bazel-*/**",
            "**/testdata/**",
        ],
    ),
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
)
```

This feeds the OCI artifact build and can be reused by other targets (linting, search indexing, etc.).

### OCI Artifact Contents

The artifact preserves the repo's directory structure so file paths in the knowledge graph match repo paths:

```
/repo-markdown/
├── manifest.json                    # {"files": {"docs/security.md": "sha256:...", ...}, "built_at": "..."}
├── docs/
│   ├── decisions/
│   │   ├── agents/001-background-agents.md
│   │   └── services/005-repo-docs-knowledge-sync.md
│   ├── plans/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── observability.md
│   └── security.md
├── projects/
│   ├── monolith/CLAUDE.md
│   ├── operators/best-practices.md
│   └── ...
├── .claude/CLAUDE.md
└── CLAUDE.md
```

### Pod Integration

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Monolith Pod"
        IC[init: repo-markdown<br/>copies to emptyDir] -->|"/repo-markdown"| MO[monolith<br/>FastAPI + gardener]
        MO -->|scans| VR["/vault<br/>(Obsidian notes)"]
        MO -->|scans| RD["/repo-markdown<br/>(OCI volume)"]
    end

    MO -->|"_processed/ artifacts"| PG[(PostgreSQL<br/>embeddings + edges)]
```

The init container uses the OCI artifact image and copies its contents to a shared `emptyDir` volume at `/repo-markdown`. The gardener scans this path as a second raw input source.

### Deletion Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant IC as Init Container
    participant MO as Monolith
    participant PG as PostgreSQL

    IC->>MO: Copy new docs + manifest.json to /repo-docs
    MO->>PG: Load previous manifest from repo_doc_state table
    MO->>MO: Diff current vs previous manifest
    alt Files removed
        MO->>PG: Delete AtomRawProvenance rows for removed files
        MO->>PG: Delete _processed/ artifacts (cascade: chunks, edges)
        Note over MO,PG: Reconciler picks up deletions on next cycle
    end
    MO->>PG: Store current manifest as new state
    MO->>MO: Gardener processes new/changed files normally
```

### Change Detection

The gardener's existing provenance system handles most of the lifecycle:

- **New file:** No provenance row → gardener decomposes it
- **Unchanged file:** Provenance row with current `GARDENER_VERSION` → skip
- **Changed file:** Content hash in `RawInput` changes → gardener re-ingests (existing behavior via `_ensure_raw_inputs`)
- **Deleted file:** Manifest diff detects removal → cleanup job deletes provenance + artifacts
- **Gardener version bump:** All repo docs re-processed (same as vault notes)

The only new logic is the manifest-based deletion — everything else rides on existing gardener infrastructure.

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Bazel Filegroup + OCI Artifact Build

- [ ] Add `repo_markdown` filegroup to root `BUILD` file (glob `**/*.md`, exclude vendored/generated)
- [ ] Create `bazel/images/repo-markdown/` with an apko config (minimal busybox image + `/repo-markdown` directory)
- [ ] Add Bazel rule to copy `repo_markdown` filegroup into the image preserving directory structure
- [ ] Add genrule to generate `manifest.json` at build time with file paths and content hashes
- [ ] Add `oci_push` target pushing to `ghcr.io/jomcgi/homelab/repo-markdown`
- [ ] Wire into CI (`buildbuddy.yaml`) to build + push on main branch

### Phase 2: Monolith Integration

- [ ] Add init container to monolith deployment template using the repo-markdown image
- [ ] Add `emptyDir` volume mounted at `/repo-markdown` shared between init container and monolith
- [ ] Add `REPO_MARKDOWN_ROOT` env var to monolith container (default: `/repo-markdown`)
- [ ] Add ArgoCD Image Updater annotation for the repo-markdown image (digest tracking)

### Phase 3: Gardener Multi-Source

- [ ] Extend `_ensure_raw_inputs` in `gardener.py` to scan `REPO_MARKDOWN_ROOT` in addition to vault
- [ ] Tag repo-doc `RawInput` rows with `source='repo'` to distinguish from vault notes
- [ ] Add `repo_doc_state` table (or reuse existing config table) to store the previous manifest
- [ ] Implement manifest diff on startup: compare current `manifest.json` vs stored state
- [ ] For removed files: delete `AtomRawProvenance` rows and corresponding `_processed/` artifacts
- [ ] Store updated manifest after successful diff + cleanup
- [ ] Gardener prompt: include `source: repo` context so decomposition can reference the repo path in edges

### Phase 4: Observability

- [ ] Add SigNoz metric: `knowledge.repo_docs.processed` (counter of repo docs ingested per cycle)
- [ ] Add SigNoz metric: `knowledge.repo_docs.deleted` (counter of orphaned artifacts cleaned up)
- [ ] Log manifest diff results at INFO level on each startup

## Security

Baseline per `docs/security.md`. No deviations.

The OCI artifact contains only markdown files already public in the GitHub repo. No secrets, no credentials. The init container runs as uid 65532 (non-root) and only copies files to an `emptyDir`.

## Risks

| Risk                                                                           | Likelihood | Impact                                    | Mitigation                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Gardener decomposes ADRs poorly (too long/structured for atomic decomposition) | Medium     | Low — bad atoms, not data loss            | Tune gardener prompt for repo doc structure; add `source: repo` hint so model adapts                   |
| Manifest diff deletes artifacts for a temporarily-missing file (build race)    | Low        | Medium — knowledge gap until re-processed | Manifest is generated deterministically at build time; only diffs against stored state, not filesystem |
| Init container blocks pod startup if image pull fails                          | Low        | Medium — monolith doesn't start           | Use `imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent`; repo-docs absence shouldn't block startup (make mount optional)   |
| Large number of docs overwhelms gardener cycle                                 | Low        | Low — gardener already rate-limits        | Gardener processes N raws per cycle with existing budget cap; repo docs queued like any other raw      |

---

## Open Questions

1. **Superseded ADR handling** — when an ADR status changes to "Superseded by NNN", should the gardener emit a `supersedes` edge and mark old artifacts, or just let the natural decomposition handle it?
2. **Exclude patterns** — beyond `node_modules/`, `bazel-*/`, and `testdata/`, are there other markdown files that should be excluded from the filegroup (e.g., vendored dependency docs, generated changelogs)?
