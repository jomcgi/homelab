  Inspect and trigger Postgres-backed scheduled jobs (gardener, calendar poll,
  vault backup, etc.) via the homelab CLI. Use when investigating "did the
  gardener run", "kick the calendar poll", "are any jobs failing or stuck",
  or when you need to trigger a job to run on the next scheduler tick without
  redeploying. Also use to spot orphan job rows whose handlers were removed
  but whose database row still exists.

# Scheduler

Inspect and trigger the monolith's Postgres-backed job scheduler via the
`homelab` CLI.

## When to Use

- User asks if a scheduled job ran, or when it last ran
- User wants to "kick", "trigger", or "force" a scheduled job to run now
- Investigating gardener / calendar-poll / vault-backup behavior
- Verifying a newly registered job is recognized after a deploy
- Spotting orphan rows (DB row exists but no handler is registered — purged on
  next pod restart)

Prefer this over digging in SigNoz logs when the question is "what does the
scheduler think the next/last run is" — that lives in the database, not the
logs.

## Auth

`homelab` authenticates via Cloudflare Access. First-time auth prompts for a
`CF_Authorization` token; cached on disk afterwards. See the `knowledge` skill
for first-run setup details — same flow.

## Commands

### List jobs

```bash
homelab scheduler jobs list
```

Output (one job per line):

```
home.calendar_poll        every   900s  next 14:32  never run
knowledge.gardener        every   600s  next 14:18  last ok at 14:08
knowledge.vault_backup    every  3600s  next 15:08  last error: timeout (last at 14:08)
orphan.removed_handler    every   300s  next 14:20  last ok at 14:15  [orphan]
```

`[orphan]` after a row means the running pod has no handler registered for
that name — the row will be purged on next pod restart by `purge_stale_jobs`.

Add `--json` for raw API output.

### Get a single job

```bash
homelab scheduler jobs get knowledge.gardener
```

Same one-line format as `list`, just for one job. Exits non-zero if the name
is unknown.

### Trigger a job to run now

```bash
homelab scheduler jobs run-now knowledge.gardener
```

Sets `next_run_at = now()` so the next scheduler tick (every ~30s) claims the
job. Idempotent: calling twice in a row is harmless. Concurrency-safe: if a
tick is already running this job, the trigger queues behind the existing run.

Exits non-zero if the name is unknown.

## Workflow

1. **List** to see all jobs and their states
2. **Get** to confirm a single job's interval / next_run_at / last_status
3. **Run-now** to kick a job; then **list** again ~30s later to see
   `last_status` updated

## Tips

- All commands support `--json`
- "Did the gardener run?" → `homelab scheduler jobs get knowledge.gardener`
  and check `last_run_at` + `last_status`
- "It says ok but I don't see effects" → `last_status` is `ok` if the handler
  returned without raising; the handler may be a no-op when nothing's
  changed. Check application logs in SigNoz for the body of the run.
- Triggering a `run-now` does **not** wait — it returns immediately after the
  DB row is updated. Wait for the scheduler tick (~30s) before re-checking.
