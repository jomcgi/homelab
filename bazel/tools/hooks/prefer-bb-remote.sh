		BLOCKED: Direct bazel/bazelisk invocations are not allowed locally.

		All Bazel work happens in CI:
		  - Tests / builds / image pushes: commit + push the branch, watch via
		    `gh pr checks <number> --watch`.
		  - Apko lockfile updates: run `format` (regenerates all locks via
		    bazel internally; allowed by this hook).
		  - Gazelle / BUILD file generation: also part of `format`.

		For CI debugging, use the BuildBuddy MCP tools:
		  mcp__buildbuddy__get_invocation   # Look up by commitSha or invocationId
		  mcp__buildbuddy__get_target       # Find failing targets in an invocation
		  mcp__buildbuddy__get_log          # Read the build/test log
		  mcp__buildbuddy__get_file_range   # Range-read CAS blob artifacts
	EOF
	exit 2
fi
