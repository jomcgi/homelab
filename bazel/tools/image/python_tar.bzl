"""python_tar - Package Python runtime + pip deps into per-platform tars.

Uses py_image_layer from @aspect_rules_py to package a shim py_venv_binary's
entire dependency tree (interpreter, stdlib, pip packages) into tar layers.
Platform transitions ensure the correct platform-specific Python toolchain
and pip wheels are selected for each target.

The tars use Bazel's runfiles layout — the Python interpreter and packages
live under the binary's .runfiles/ tree. The tools image BUILD (Task 5)
adds a wrapper script at /usr/bin/python3 that execs the real interpreter.

Produces for each platform:
  :{name}_linux_amd64 - platform-transitioned py_image_layer tars
  :{name}_linux_arm64 - platform-transitioned py_image_layer tars
  :{name}_darwin_arm64 - platform-transitioned py_image_layer tars
