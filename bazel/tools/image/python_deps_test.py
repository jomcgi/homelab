"""Tests for python_deps.py — the shim binary that packages pip deps into the tools image.

python_deps.py has no functions of its own; it is a shim that imports the
pip packages that must be present in the tools image (httpx, typer) so that
py_image_layer can discover and package their transitive dependency trees.

These tests verify that those imports are actually resolvable at test time,
which catches cases where a package is removed from the dep list or the dep
declaration drifts out of sync with what is actually needed.
