"""Wire shapes for the scheduler API.

The view model intentionally omits the lock columns (``locked_by``, ``locked_at``)
from the underlying ``ScheduledJob`` SQLModel. Those are claim-machinery internals
of ``shared.scheduler._claim_next_job``; surfacing them would invite tooling that
races against the SKIP LOCKED claim.
