"""Coverage tests for shared/chunker.py gaps.

Fills gaps identified in the coverage review:
- Oversized fenced code block falls into the word-split path.
- Trailing header with no body is silently dropped.
- Heading-only document hits the sections=[] fallback and returns a chunk
  with section_header="" (surprising behaviour, pinned here).
- The unreachable `if current:` inside the word-split inner loop is documented
  (dead code analysis).
