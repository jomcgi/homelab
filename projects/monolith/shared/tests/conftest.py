"""BDD test fixtures for the shared scheduler domain.

Scheduler handlers claim their own DB sessions via ``get_engine()``, so the
SAVEPOINT-based ``session`` fixture from the shared plugin can't be used —
scheduler commits happen on separate connections and wouldn't be visible to
a SAVEPOINT-wrapped session. Instead, we point ``DATABASE_URL`` at the real
test Postgres, clear ``get_engine``'s cache, and rely on explicit cleanup.
