"""BDD tests for the concurrent scheduler dispatcher.

Uses a real PostgreSQL instance because ``FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`` and the
advisory-lock semantics are PG-specific and cannot be faithfully mocked.

The key concurrency oracle is wall-clock time: if N jobs each sleep S seconds
and the dispatcher finishes in ~S seconds (not ~N*S), they ran in parallel.
