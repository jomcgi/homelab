# Knowledge Pipeline

LLM-powered knowledge graph with on-cluster inference.

## Overview

Raw markdown is ingested, decomposed into structured facts by Qwen-3 (with self-critique for quality), embedded with voyage-4-nano, and stored in pgvector for semantic search. Fronted by a SvelteKit app with a `Cmd+K` search overlay.
