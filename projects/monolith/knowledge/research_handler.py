"""Scheduled-job handler for knowledge.research-gaps.

Every tick: pulls up to RESEARCH_BATCH_SIZE external+classified gaps,
runs the Sonnet research agent (single subprocess that triages and
optionally researches), routes per disposition.

  - ``research`` + non-empty post-filter claims: write the research raw,
    state -> "committed".
  - ``research`` + empty post-filter claims (everything failed citation
    check): quarantine the draft, bump ``research_attempts``. Below
    threshold the stub is left in place so the next tick retries; at
    threshold the gap is parked and the stub is deleted.
  - ``personal``: gap_class flips to ``internal``, state stays
    ``classified``. Sonnet caught a mis-classification. The stub is
    deleted -- if the term reappears in another note, the gardener
    will queue a fresh stub for re-classification.
  - ``discard``: gap_class flips to ``parked``, state -> ``parked``.
    Sonnet decided this isn't worth researching at all. Stub deleted.
  - Infra failures (claude subprocess timeout / non-zero exit / parse
    error) revert state without burning a research attempt.

Stubs MUST be deleted on every terminal disposition: the reconciler
projects ``_researching/<slug>.md`` frontmatter into the Gap row on
every cycle, so a stub left at ``status: classified`` reverts the DB
back to ``classified`` and the gap is re-picked indefinitely.

Triage is a refinement of the upstream ``gap_classifier``, not a
replacement -- the classifier's "external" candidates flow into here,
and Sonnet may downgrade them based on full vault context.
