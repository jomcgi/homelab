"""Claude-backed gap classifier.

Spawns a `claude --print` subprocess with a batch of stub paths and a
classification rubric. Claude reads each stub's frontmatter via the Read
tool, decides one of four classes, and uses Edit to update the stub's
frontmatter in place. Allowed tools are restricted to Read and Edit —
the classifier cannot Write new files or Bash new processes.

The reconciler (on its next tick) projects the updated frontmatter into
the Gap row. This module does not touch the DB directly.

Privacy-conservative fallback: if Claude returns an invalid class or
cannot decide, the stub stays `gap_class: null` and gets retried by the
next classifier tick. We do not auto-route to internal just because the
classifier hiccuped.

_CLASSIFIER_PROMPT = """\
You are classifying knowledge graph gaps — unresolved [[wikilinks]] in an
Obsidian vault — into four classes.

## The four classes

- **external**: publicly-researchable concept. Example: "Linkerd mTLS",
  "Rust ownership", "Merkle tree". A web search or public docs would
  find primary sources.
- **internal**: only the user can resolve. Example: their therapist's
  name, a shorthand for a friend, notes about their own childhood or
  work decisions. Searching the web is useless AND a privacy leak.
- **hybrid**: externally researchable but benefits from user annotation.
  Example: "my-config-for-neovim" — the tool exists externally, but the
  user's specific setup is personal.
- **parked**: queryable but not worth current budget. Example: highly
  niche terms, project-specific jargon that may never be revisited.

## Rules

- **Privacy-conservative default:** if uncertain between external/internal,
  choose internal. Over-routing to user is tolerated. Over-routing to web
  is treated as a defect.
- **Use the Read tool** to inspect each stub's frontmatter (id, title,
  referenced_by). The referenced_by list tells you which source notes
  link to this term — that's your context.
- **Use the Edit tool** to update these frontmatter fields. The stub's
  frontmatter already contains all four keys with placeholder values
  (`gap_class: null`, `status: discovered`, `classified_at: null`,
  `classifier_version: null`). For each key, find the existing line and
  replace it — do not add a new line. YAML requires unique top-level
  keys; appending a duplicate key produces an ugly stub even when YAML
  parsers tolerate it. Example:
  - find: `status: discovered` → replace with: `status: classified`
  - find: `gap_class: null` → replace with one of: `gap_class: external`
    | `gap_class: internal` | `gap_class: hybrid` | `gap_class: parked`
  - find: `classified_at: null` → replace with the current ISO timestamp
    (UTC, e.g. `classified_at: '2026-04-25T08:00:00Z'`)
  - find: `classifier_version: null` → replace with
    `classifier_version: {classifier_version}`
- **Do not** modify any other field. Do not add a body. Do not write new
  files. Do not run any Bash command.
- If you cannot decide on a class for a stub, skip it (leave gap_class
  null). Do not guess.
